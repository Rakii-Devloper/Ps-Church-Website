                    <p>1. We believe in the one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit the creator of all things. (1 Cor. 8:6, 1 Jon. 5:7)</p>
                    <p>2. We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God was conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, was buried, resurrected. And ascended into Heaven in bodily form, and is now seated at the right hand of God the Father and He’s true God and true Man. (Lk. 3:34-35, Rev. 1:18)</p>
                    <p>3. We believe the Bible in its entirety to be the inspired Word of God and the infallible rule of faith and conduct. (2 Tim. 3:16, 2 Pet. 1:21)</p>
                    <p>4. We believe in the physical Resurrection of the Dead, the eternal happiness of the saved and the eternal punishment of the lost without salvation in Jesus Christ. (Jon. 5:29, 11:25)</p>
                    <p>5. We believe in the utter depravity of mankind and in personal salvation of believers through the shed blood of Jesus Christ. (Jon. 3:3-5)</p>
                    <p>6. We believe in sanctification through the Word of God by the Holy Spirit and in personal holiness of heart and life. (Jon. 17:17, Rom. 15:6)</p>
                    <p>7. We believe in divine healing through Faith in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that healing is included in the Atonement. (Mk. 16:17-18)</p>
                    <p>8. We believe in Water Baptism, in the Baptism of the Holy Spirit as distinct from the new birth, in speaking in tongues as the Spirit of God give the utterance, in the Gifts of the Spirit, and the evidence of the fruit of the Spirit. We believe that all are available to believers even today. (Mk. 16:16, Acts 2:4, 1 Cor. 12:7-11, Gal. 5:22-23)</p>
                    <p>9. We believe that there is a warfare to all believers and true followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, but that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds. (2 Cor. 10:3-6, Eph. 6:10-18)</p>
                    <p>10. We believe in the Christian Hope – the soon coming, personal return of our Lord Jesus Christ. (Jon. 14:1-3, Acts 1:10-11)</p>
                    <p>11. We believe in Evangelism and Missionary work in accordance with the Great Commission. (Mat. 28:19)</p>
                    <p>12. We believe there is great preparation being made in Heaven for them that believe, and in the command of the Lord Jesus Christ to go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that My house may be filled. (Lk. 14:23)</p>
